## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, I have added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

* In order to perform a search now a user can enter in just one field as shown below in either date, city, state, country or shape. How ever if you are looking for something more specific you can use the fields to your advantage to filter your search down. For example if a user already knew the counrty, state, and shape then entering those fields will have fewer results than just the field of state or shape.

* If the user only knows one of the fields then filtered results will be greater as shown. You could be combing through data until you find what you are looking for.

* AS shown above having three fields filtering out results brings you to a smaller data set and a faster way for you to retreive your results.



## Summary: In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development.

* One drawback of this webpage is if the user does not clear all fields then the search might not provide any results. For example, if a user was looking for UFO sightings in Indiana but never cleared the "shape" field of "circle" then no results would show up when in fact Indiana does have 1 UFO sighting.

* Two additional recommendations for further development would be scrapping from a website with real time data and up to date data for more possible search results. An addtional recommendation would be making the filters not case sensitive, if you put "IN" instead of "in" no results will show up. Making the filters non case sensitive could help users have an overall better experience with less hassle from the table.
